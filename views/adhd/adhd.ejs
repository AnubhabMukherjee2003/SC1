      <h1>ADHD</h1>
      <p>ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by symptoms
        of inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity. It is currently diagnosed in both children and adults, and its
        impact can be seen in multiple aspects of life, such as home, school, and work.
        <br><br>

        <strong>What it is</strong>
        <br><br>
        ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first diagnosed in
        childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble paying attention, controlling
        impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the result will be), or be overly active.<br><br>
        <strong>types</strong><br><br>
        There are three different ways ADHD presents itself, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest in the
        individual at the time of diagnosis:

        Predominantly inattentive presentation
        Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation
        Combined presentation (a combination of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms)<br><br>
        Signs and symptoms<br><br>
        It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another. However, for children with ADHD, the symptoms continue, can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.<br><br>
        Diagnosis<br><br>
        Deciding if someone has ADHD is a process with several steps. There is no single test to diagnose ADHD, and many other problems, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities, can have similar symptoms. One step of the process involves having a medical exam, including hearing and vision tests, to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD.<br><br>Treatment and managing symptoms
        <br><br>In most cases, ADHD is best treated with a combination of behavior therapy and medication. For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly training for parents, is recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is tried. What works best can depend on the child and family. Effective treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.
        <br><br>Managing symptoms: Staying healthy
        <br><br>Being healthy is important for everyone and can be especially important for people with ADHD. In addition to behavioral therapy and medication, having a healthy lifestyle can make it easier to deal with ADHD symptoms. Here are some healthy behaviors that may help:

        Developing healthy eating habits such as eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains and choosing lean protein sources
        Participating in daily physical activity based on age
        Limiting the amount of daily screen time from TVs, computers, phones, and other electronics
        Getting the recommended amount of sleep each night based on age
        <br><br>What CDC is doing
        <br><br>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funds the National Resource Center on ADHD (NRC), a program of CHADDâ€“Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Their website has links to information for people with ADHD and their families. The NRC operates a call center (1-866-200-8098) with trained staff to answer questions about ADHD.
        <br><br>Resources and tools
        <br><br>To get help with concerns about ADHD, talk with your child's healthcare provider. Primary healthcare providers may diagnose ADHD or may provide a referral to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or psychiatrist. Children can be seen by a specialist such as a child psychologist, child psychiatrist, or developmental pediatrician.
        <br><br><strong>how an adhd person deals through everyday task</strong>
        <br>A person with ADHD often navigates everyday tasks with challenges related to focus, organization, and time management. They might struggle to prioritize tasks, get easily distracted, or feel overwhelmed by multiple responsibilities. Simple routines can require extra effort, as their mind may jump from one thought to another, leading to incomplete tasks or procrastination. Despite these challenges, many people with ADHD develop coping strategies, like breaking tasks into smaller steps, using reminders, or creating structured routines to manage their day more effectively.
